**Update:** the duplicator has now been reduced to scrap and is no longer available - its destruction is documented [here](https://george-hawkins.github.io/project-graveyard/dvd-duplicator/).

I've got a DVD duplicator to give away - you need to be based in or around Zurich, Switzerland and be able to collect it.

See <https://george-hawkins.github.io/dvd-duplicator/> for details.
